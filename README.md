# Website-content-analyzer-using-NLP

## Overview

The project involves developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool using the spaCy library to extract and analyze text data related to terrorism from webpage or website. The tool parses the text to identify and categorize nouns and proper nouns (e.g., persons) and matches them against a predefined list of terrorism-related keywords. The project showcases skills in web scraping with BeautifulSoup, text processing with spaCy, and data manipulation with Python collections, highlighting capabilities in extracting meaningful insights from large text datasets.
